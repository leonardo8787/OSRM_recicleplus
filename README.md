# OSRM_recicleplus
Recycling routes optimized with OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine). It is possible to generalize the application to different contexts where software is used to search or route something. In this context, recicle uses OSRM to generate routes from selective collections, so that collectors can optimize their collection of recyclables during use.
